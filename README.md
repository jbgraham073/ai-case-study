# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

•	Founded in 2009
•	Founded by Tom Siebel, who remains as Chairman and CEO today
•	C3.ai has evolved its branding and product portfolio over the years to achieve market leadership like many of the tech giants (spanning many industries and applications).  C3.ai was founded with a focus on developing software for cloud computing, big data, and predictive analytics.
•	C3.ai has received a total of $410M in funding, including 15 investors (13 institutional / 2 angels), all over 9 rounds of funding.  The largest round to date was $100M in 2018.

##Business Activities

•	C3.ai aims to efficiently and economically support the development of large-scale enterprise AI applications, surpassing other know market methods in effectiveness, spanning a wide variety of industries.
•	C3.ai casts a wide net targeting a vast range of potential enterprise customers.  Targeted segments include manufacturing, financial services, government, utilities, oil and gas, chemicals, agriculture, defense and intelligence. With the wide range of target segments, the overall market size was estimated in 2020 to be approximately $174 billion.
•	C3.ai has developed a unique set of applications, collectively called the C3.ai Suite, which enables clients to quickly and effortlessly integrate digital transformation applications.  The use a unique model driven architecture to allow for rapid development and implementation. Along with this, the company has a patent on the model-based solution. 
•	At a high level, the company uses big data, IoT, AI/predictive analytics, machine learning, elastic cloud computing.  The company integrates these broad stroke technologies on a SaaS platform to solve AI problems for enterprise partners at industrial and commercial scale.

## LANDSCAPE

•	C3.ai is in the information technology industry.
•	Over the past decade, the enterprise solution segment in the IT sector has been transformed by the adoption of cloud computing, AI and ML, with a focus on enhanced cybersecurity, big data analytics, IoT integration, mobile technology, and automation. This evolution reflects a shift towards more efficient, customized, and user-friendly solutions.
•	Specific to the Enterprise AI sector, other top companies include UiPath, SambaNova, DataRobot, and Dataiku.  To note, there are many emerging start-ups in this space, but these are some of the larger players alongside C3.ai.

## Results

•	Currently, C3.ai’s offerings are revolutionizing major entities such as Shell, Cargill, and the U.S. Air Force by tackling key challenges like supply chain interruptions, managing environmental, social and governance performance, and reducing unexpected downtime of vital assets, thereby generating annual economic benefits worth billions of dollars for said companies.
•	C3.ai is a publicly traded company, in which stock price, along with overall market share are key indicators of success.  Historically their share price dropped drastically shortly after their IPO in late 2020, continuing to decline until this year, in which they have seen some recovery driven by partnerships with core customers and partnership agreements with AWS, etc.   
•	Market Share wise, C3.ai still underperforming original expectations and in some ranking reports are around 16th to other major competitors in the Enterprise AI space.  Regardless of the decline, the company has seen a revitalized performance baseline with the general rise/hype around AI in 2023.  

## Recommendations

•	This is a VERY difficult topic considering the company has, in theory, built a future proof, all-encompassing solution for enterprise customers when looking at their model driven architecture.  This is supposed to be their secret sauce, ensuring enterprise customers that their model driven solution will work with whatever services the customer has setup and/or wants to setup in the future, including foundational databases.  That said, outside of their model driven architecture, a core revenue driver could be to develop some proprietary offerings that rival competitors in the space (think Snowflake, etc.).
•	This would give them a bit of an escape to sell proprietary products to further expand revenue and double down on their unique solution.  This would help if consulting with a dated company that needs to upgrade individual solutions, ultimately selling additional foundational systems that would help the company even more.  This tech sits on top of what is existing for enterprise customers, and some of those foundational systems are likely outdated with older companies trying to integrate an AI solution to their business. 
•	Technologies could include, but not limited to cloud computing, database management, and PIM/DAM solutions to name a few.
•	As mentioned above, having a proprietary set of offerings would be a great way to have an extended set of offerings when building custom/unique solutions for companies.
